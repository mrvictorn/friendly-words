## The challenge:

Two words are considered “friendly” if there exists a one to one mapping of letters between the two.

For instance…

GAGA and BOBO are friendly because mapping G<->B and A<->O would make them the same.

HHHH and BOBO are not friendly. Neither are JKKJ and JKKJJ.

#### This list…

#### How many words are there in the list with at least one friend?
